Too much pinned memory can interfere with CPU performance, so use it only with intention. Pinned memory should be freed with `cudaFreeHost`.\n",

    "In addition to `cudaMemcpy` is `cudaMemcpyAsync` which can asynchronously copy memory either from host to device or from device to host as long as the host memory is pinned, which can be done by allocating it with `cudaMallocHost`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to kernel execution, `cudaMemcpyAsync` is only asynchronous by default with respect to the host. It executes, by default, in the default stream and therefore is a blocking operation with regard to other CUDA operations occurring on the GPU. The `cudaMemcpyAsync` function, however, takes as an optional 5th argument, a non-default stream. By passing it a non-default stream, the memory transfer can be concurrent to other CUDA operations occurring in other non-default streams.\n",

    "In the following example, rather than wait for the entire memory copy to complete before beginning work on the kernel, segments of the required data are copied and worked on, with each copy/work segment running in its own non-default stream. Using this technique, work on parts of the data can begin while memory transfers for later segments occur concurrently. Extra care must be taken when using this technique to calculate segment-specific values for the number of operations, and the offset location inside arrays, as shown here:\n",

The performance gains here are in the ability to start the transfers earlier than otherwise, and it is not hard to imagine in an application where a less trivial amount of work was being done compared to a simple addition operation, that the memory copies would not only start earlier, but also overlap with kernel execution."
